            <h2>Description of an Ocean Sunfish</h2>
            <p>Sunfish, or mola, develop their truncated, bullet-like shape because the back fin which they are born with simply never grows. 
                Instead, it folds into itself as the enormous creature matures,creating a rounded rudder called a clavus. 
                Mola in Latin means "millstone" and describes the ocean sunfish’s somewhat circular shape.
                Sunfish comprise a group of five unique species that roam the deep waters of the world. 
                Though they are fast-growing and cumbersome, don't be fooled into thinking that sunfish can't fend for themselves! 
                Sunfish are voracious predators and one of the ocean's greatest eaters.
                Sunfish are also endless record breakers - as we'll learn. They are the largest bony fish - the biggest one ever weighed being over 2.7 tons, growing to over 3m long and 4m from fin to fin!
                They are a silvery color and have a rough skin texture.</p>

        <!---Life--->
        <section class = "life">
            <h2>Life of an Ocean Sunfish</h2>
            <p>Sunfish inhabit the epipelagic zone, the upper 200m of the ocean where sunlight illuminates the world. However, sunfish can easily dive to depths of over 600m - into the mesopelagic zone, also known as the twilight zone. 
                In this zone, waters become much darker, pressure increases and temperatures drop to almost freezing. 
                All sunfish inhabit temperate and tropical seas. The ocean sunfish, southern sunfish, slender sunfish and sharptail mola have 
                all been identified circumglobally, in all five oceans. The newly discovered hoodwinker sunfish has only been identified in the southern Pacific 
                and Indian oceans, from Chile to South Africa, but it likely has a similar distribution to other species. 
                All five species have been spotted in Cape Town.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Sunfish lay more eggs than any other kind of animal - in fact, a single Mola mola can lay over 300 million eggs at a time! 
                    This is necessary, as their reproductive strategy is quite risky - males and females spawn huge amounts of eggs and sperm into the water column,
                    and basically hope for the best. They have no specific courtship rituals or mating seasons - they simply take advantage of being near to other 
                    sunfish (multiple research attempts have failed to link mating to any specific pattern).
                    When sunfish larvae hatch they are only 2mm long, and they stay in small schools as they develop into fry, for protection from predators. 
                    They grow rapidly, and once they develop their mature body shape they leave the school and brave the ocean on their own.
                    All sunfish are active predators, swimming many kilometres a day to find their prey. Until recently, it was believed that sunfish preyed only on jellyfish, but recent research has shown that their prey is much more diverse. Notably, sunfish have been found to spend a great deal of time in waters up to 200m deep hunting for siphonophores - animals that travel in colonies, like blue bottles.
                </p>
              
                <h3>Threats to Survival</h3>
                <p>In the wild that layer of jelly under their skin makes the sunfish taste absolutely terrible. Fortunately for sunfish, and the thousands of parasites they host, their gooey flesh and awkward size and shape are all reasons that humans throughout history couldn't be bothered to eat sunfish except in a few rare occurences.
                    However, Sunfish are predated on by orcas, great white sharks and seals. Sea lions seem like the most vicious predator - often they will simply eat the fins off of the sunfish and leave it to die slowly (warning: link is upsetting). When young, sunfish are preyed on by bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) and dorado (Coryphaena hippurus).</p>
                <br>
                <p>But, their population is considered vulnerable. This is due to the fact that Sunfish frequently get snagged in drift gill nets and can suffocate on sea trash, like plastic bags, which resemble jellyfish. The greatest risk facing sunfish is being caught as bycatch - in fact in some industries, more ocean sunfish are caught than the actual target species! In South Africa alone over 340 000 are unintentionally caught a year! Longline, gill nets and mid-water trawls are all hazards to sunfish, commonly making up more 20-50% of all bycatch in industries such as swordfish, tuna and Cape horse mackerel.
                    Littered plastic, particularly plastic shopping bags, are another major risk facing ocean sunfish. In the water column, these bags drift just like Mola mola's favourite snack - a tasty jelly. A sunfish could choke to death immediately, or starve slowly from intestinal blockages. This is a threat facing many pelagic species, and another great reason to Rethink the Bag.
                    Smaller species such as the sharptail mola and the slender sunfish are not currently recognised as being at risk, and the southern and hoodwinker sunfish are listed as being data deficient, although likely face the same perils as Mola mola, due to sharing a range and lifestyle.
                </p>

            <h3>Life in Captivity</h3>
            <p>The ocean sunfish is an unusual fish that draws a lot of public attention, but is rarely kept in aquariums. The Two Oceans Aquarium is one of a select few that keep them on occasion, others being the world-class Nordsøen Oceanarium in Denmark, Monterey Bay Aquarium in the USA, Lisbon Oceanarium in Portugal, Kaiyukan Aquarium in Japan and L'Oceanogràfic in Spain.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The reason that sunfish are so rarely kept in captivity is because to their large size and cumbersome swimming patterns – an exhibit hosting one needs to be big enough for the sunfish to move freely. Their rapid growth also poses challenges when it comes time to release them. Capturing an ocean sunfish without injuring it is also a challenge requiring special equipment, and in most cases sunfish that are displayed have been rescued, e.g. bycatch survivors from fishing vessels or, as is the case for sunfish at the Two Oceans Aquarium, ones that become trapped and/or injured in ports, drydocks and harbours.</p>

        <section class = "species">
            <h2>Species of an Ocean Sunfish</h2>
            <p>As mentioned before there are many species of the Ocean Sunfish.Presently, five species are recognized within the family Molidae. 
                Species include: the common mola, Mola mola (Linnaeus 1758); giant ocean sunfish, Mola alexandrini (Ranzani 1839); the hoodwinker sunfish, 
                Mola tecta (Nyegaard et al. 2017); the sharptail sunfish, Masturus lanceolatus (Lienard 1840); and the slender sunfish, 
                Ranzania laevis (Pennant 1776).</p>
                <br>
            <p>All species of sunfishes are found in tropical and temperate ocean basins. 
                Recent tagging studies have finally laid to rest the historical characterization of sunfishes as passive drifters (Pope et al. 2010). 
                These tagging studies have revealed that sunfishes have high-performance burst swimming abilities (e.g. Watanabe and Sato 2008, Nakamura and Sato 2014, 
                Nakamura et al. 2015, ( 6m/s) Thys et al. 2015 ) and can swim long distances against major currents (e.g. Cartamil and Lowe 2004, Sims et al. 2009, Dewar et al. 2010, Sousa et al. 2016, Chang et al. 2019).</p>

            <h3>Mola mola, The Common Mola</h3>
            <img src = "../images/commonmola.jpg" alt = "common mola-mola">
            <P>The most abundant and widespread of ocean sunfishes in the northern hemisphere is Mola mola. 
                These fish, like all ocean sunfishes, have a peculiar body form (morphology). 
                They are deep-body and truncated with a large head and a set of long dorsal and anal fins, reminiscent of a plane’s wings. 
                These exaggerated, vertically oriented fins help sunfish produce the lift-based swimming ability that they need to effectively traverse large horizontal and vertical distances in the ocean.
                Mola mola have a rounded tail when they are juveniles which can become scalloped as they mature and become larger. 
                Some adults in the eastern Atlantic can possess a bulbous head similar to Mola alexandrini. The scales of M. mola are multi-cusped and jagged making their skin very gritty like rough sandpaper. 
                M. mola are covered with copious amounts of mucus and typically silvery in color with a slight opalescent sheen and can also be dappled with spots. M. mola’s clavus (the sunfish version of a “tail”) is supported by 8-9 ossicles (small, bony formations) and 10-13 rays (Nyegaard et al. 2016). 
                M. mola can grow to be enormous: nearly 11 feet long and 2910 lbs (Heilner 1920, Kawakami et al. 2008, respectively).</P>

            <h3>Mola alexandrini, the Giant Ocean Sunfish</h3>
            <img src = "../images/alexandrini.jpg" alt = "giant mola-alexandrini">
            <p>Mola alexandrini is similar to Mola mola, particularly in its juvenile stages, but diverges as itmatures by retaining a rounded clavus. M. mola, in contrast, can develop a wavy, scalloped clavus in its largest size. M. alexandrini’s rounded clavus is supported by 8-15 (average 12) ossicles and 14-24 (average 17) fin rays. Adults have an enlarged bulbous head, chin bump and rectangular scales. M. alexandrini can similarly grow to be huge: maximum size records are nearly 11 feet long and 5070 lbs (Yoshita et al. 2009, Sawai et al. 2018, respectively). M. alexandrini is found in both temperate and tropical waters. Scales of M. alexandrini are rounded when small (29-51 cm TL) becoming more rectangular at larger sizes (>120 cm)</p>

            <h3>Mola tecta, the Hoodwinker Sunfish</h3>
            <img src = "../images/hoodwinker.jpg" alt = "hoodwinker mola-tecta">
            <p>Mola tecta is the first new sunfish species described in over 130 years (see Nyegaard et al. 2018). They are known to reside in the southern hemisphere, with most records from South America, South Africa, Australasian waters and New Zealand. However, specimens of this species have been recorded along the California coast in 2019. M. tecta has a rounded clavus and a pronounced back-fold with 5-7 ossicles and 15-17 fin rays (Nyegaard et al. 2016). The scales of M. tecta are distinct from the other molids in that the raised conical mid-points of the scales are set far apart from each other.</p>

            <h3>Masturus lanceolatus, The Sharptail Sunfish </h3>
            <img src = "../images/sharptailmola.jpg" alt = "sharptail mola-lanceolatus">
            <p>As their common name implies, Masturus lanceolatus, have a bit more to their tail (e.g. a “median extension”) than Mola mola. Additionally, Ma. lanceolatus’ clavus is not scalloped. Similarly colored to Mola mola, Ma. lanceolatus has smoother skin and produces less mucus. Interestingly, Ma. lanceolatus are not consummate sunbathers and are more tropical in their distribution. While Ma. lanceolatus is currently the only accepted species in this cosmopolitan genus, there are more species waiting to be formally described. Ma. lanceolatus can grow quite large, as large as 10 feet long and 902 lbs (Gudger and MacDonald 1935, Gudger 1937; Liu et al. 2009, respectively).</p>

            <h3>Ranzania laevis, The Slender Sunfish</h3>
            <img src = "../images/slendersunfish.jpg" alt = "slender mola-laevis">
            <p>Mola laevis, The Slender Sunfish is the smallest of mature adult sunfishes, reaching only approximately 74 cm in total length (Bloch and Schneider 1801). Additionally, R. laevis is less deep-bodied than other sunfishes, is oblong in shape, and has elongate pectoral fins. R. laevis is the most colorful of the ocean sunfishes, with smoother, thinner skin and funnel-shaped lips. With only one species currently recognized in the genus Ranzania, it is very likely that there are more species waiting to be formally described.</p>
